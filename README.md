## 🚀 About Me

I'm a systems-focused developer based in Bengaluru, India, with a deep interest in infrastructure, networking, and scalable web systems.

I don’t just build applications —  
I design how they run, scale, and survive in production.

My work combines:

- 🏗 Infrastructure thinking  
- ☁️ Cloud-native deployment  
- 🔐 Secure authentication systems  
- ⚡ Performance optimization  
- 🤖 AI integration into real systems  

Outside of development, I fly FPV drones and manage live technical operations for large-scale events — because engineering should exist both in code and in the real world.
